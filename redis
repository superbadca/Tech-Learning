redis is a key-value store used for caching as well as persistance.

Firstly, as a cache it is an in-memory nosql db that just has commands to create and store various data structures like lists etc, without using SQL commands.
It can also write to disk using either journaling (incremental) or snapshots. 
It is popular generally, but especially for containers.
