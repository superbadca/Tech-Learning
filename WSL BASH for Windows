I was frustrated with not being able to use the linux commands that I saw in examples.  I downloaded WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) and am using it as my terminal.  

WSL is just a mapping of Bash commands to Windows modules, and is therefor quite limited.  Many bash tools that you download just won't work.  I chose Ubuntu 18.04

There is a WSL2 in the works that will actually be linux running in a custom VM.  This will be much more robust, but you will need the Windows Professional to run the VM.

If you are in the wsl terminal and want access to files on your windows C drive file system, the mount point is:
/mnt/c
