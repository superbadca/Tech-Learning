If you aren't using DHCP, your config file would look like

DEVICE=enp0s3
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
PREFIX=24 (this is the subnet mask)
IPADDR=10.0.1.27

note that if you made a change you'd have to 
nmcli c reload   to have the connection reloaded.

The easiest way to give a name to an ip address is in the
/etc/hosts file

This is actually important test hack - have unwanted sites resolve to bad names
