Jupyter can be used as an IDE to make learning Python easy and an entry point to machine learning.
There are 2 components to Jupyter: the app which is written is JS and runs in the browser, and a server.

This is from the lynda (linkedin) course called "Introducing Jupyter"

Installing Jupyter
Don't bother.  Install Anaconda - a Python distro instead.  It comes with Jupyter, NumPy, pandas and other data analysis tools.
Go to anaconda.com and download the 3.7 version.  Don't bother with VS Code.

Starting Jupyter
> jupyter notebook

Stopping Jupyter
Note that closing the browser does not stop the process.  
Either:
from the notebook tab> close and halt
from the dashboard> select and shutdown

You can close the Jupyter server by
> ctrl-c ctrl-c from the terminal
or 
>quit button at the top ot the page.

Saving
UI> file + save
This will save but also create a checkpoint.  The checkpoint means is saving the previous version of the file.  There is only one version retained. The file type of the backed-up notebook is .ipynb
