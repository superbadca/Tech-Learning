TCP is for the receiving host to know which application the packet contents are for.  It does this by mapping ports to apps.  Ports are not physical, they are virtual concepts.
Server side apps use well-know ports so clients know how to connect to them.  Client side ports are chosen because they are unused.

The IP level and below is for the sending host to know where to send the packet so that it gets to the right receiver.  To do this, network elements (configuration) is allocated to a physical device. This includes an IP address (static assignment or by DHCP including the subnet (mask).  As well the MAC address. which is mapped to ip address by ARP.

The router can be on a host but is usually on a seperate machine.  It's ip address is the default gateway, or the IP address that does not match any subnet mask.  It uses DNS to route external traffic.  Troubleshooting tools include ncat (formerly netcat), nmap, ss and nslookup.

Tools
IP commannd relaces old ifconfig commands. Changes will not survive a restart unless the correct file is edited manually.
arp = ip neighbor
ifconfig = ip address ip link is -s
iwconfig = iw
nameif = ip link
netstat = ip route
route = ip route

localhost means only the host machine can access the port.
0.0.0.0 means any computer can access the port
