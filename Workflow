Dockerhub has the idea of automated workflow built in.  There is a 'build settings' tab which allows you to listen for github events.  You can listen for a git commit and take actions. For example:
- you push code to github 
- Github compiles code and kick off test tasks using Jenkins
- Dockerhub listens for github event, build an image on Dockerhub
- send a webhook to production environment
- Prod receive a webhook 
- pull the image to the production environment
- restart the containers
