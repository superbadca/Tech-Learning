DHCP is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocal.  DHCP configure the devices on a client  host including assigning an IP address.  
DHCP server usually resides on the router but can be on the host too.

This is an example of a dynamically configured network interface config file:
DEVICE=enp0s3
BOOTPRO=dhcp
ONBOOT=Yes

DHCP configurations are overwritten by static configurations in /etc/hostnames?
