Gherkin is a text specification language that comes from the BDD and the Ruby world.

For Python, there is Python Behave and pytest-bdd to read the Gherkin and run the tests.

The format of a Scenario is:
Given: preconditions, no user interactions
When: action that is visible to user
Then: result that is visible to user

Given, When, Then, And, But are called "Steps"
There should be less that 10 steps in a scenario.

There are roughly 12 Scenarios per feature.

Tags @ are used to control which test are run.  That is, you can tag some tests as @smoke 

All data in the first step is put in a context variable for all steps to access.

There are 3 types of data:
- Test Case Data: input and outputs used to test features
- Configuration Data: Variables that have to be changed to make the test cases run in a different enviroment. They are not kept with the test cases. They are kept in config files
