Gherkin is a text specification language that comes from the BDD and the Ruby world.

For Python, there is Python Behave and pytest-bdd to read the Gherkin and run the tests.

The format is:
Given: preconditions, no user interactions
When: action that is visible to user
Then: result that is visible to user

Tags @ are used to control which test are run.  That is, you can tag some tests as @smoke 

All data in the first step is put in a context variable for all steps to access.
