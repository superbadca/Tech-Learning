After installing Flask Flask-RESTful, FLASK-JWT..

Python has builtin support for SQLite so we don't need to install libraries for it.
SQLite stores data in a flat binary file. It is slower than real databases for writing. We'll call this one data.db.  data.db will be the URI for the datadabase.

Outside of code folder make a .py file.
import sqlite3 ** this library is for making queries to the builtin sqlite database
connection = sqlite3.connect('data.db')  ** have to initialize connection  to make connection to db

cursor = connection.cursor()
** cursor is a an entity that selects and starts. for example  the procedure and storeing the result.

** to create a table, this defines columns.  This is called a query
create_table = "CREATE TABLE users (id int, username text, password text)"
cursor.execute(create_table)

user = (1, 'jose', 'asdf')
insert_query = "INSERT INTO users VALUES (?,?,?)
cursor.execute(insert_query, user)

users =

connection.commit()
** tell connection to save
connection.close()
** don't consume resources waiting for more data.
